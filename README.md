<h3>Brief</h3>
To develop a front end application that addresses a specific problem faced by bootcampers. Your goal is to improve the overall experience of your fellow bootcampers, focusing on aspects such as remote learning, knowledge retention, or collaboration. 

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Through brainstorms and dot voting, we decided unanimously that one of the biggest problems' we faced on the bootcamp was forgetting material covered in previous weeks and decided to build an application to combat this. Hence the memory jogger was born.
