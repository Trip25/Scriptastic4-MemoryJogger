<h3>Brief</h3>
To develop a front end application that addresses a specific problem faced by bootcampers. Your goal is to improve the overall experience of your fellow bootcampers, focusing on aspects such as remote learning, knowledge retention, or collaboration. 

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Through brainstorms and dot voting, we decided unanimously that one of the biggest problems' we faced on the bootcamp was forgetting material covered in previous weeks and decided to build an application to combat this. Hence the memory jogger was born.

<h3>Design Process</h3>
- Used Figjam and Figma to design low-fi and high fidelity wireframes.
- Images used for the application were generated using Midjourney creating a skeumorphic design. Our team logo was also created using Midjourney images and editted together.



<h3>Testing</h3>
We had tests that checked whetherâ€¦
- the page renders
- the textboxes and buttons are on the page
- the Clear Facts button is on the page
- the title and fact boxes get emptied when Add Flashcard is clicked
- the local storage contains the added flashcard (after a refresh)

<h3>Post-project goals</h3>
- Try to implement TDD as tests were only implemented after writing our code. In future, we could improve by following Red, Green, Refactor/the three laws of TDD
- Dedicate time to refactor
- Dedicate time to fix CSS positioning.

All in all, I am proud of the collaboration of the team and how swiftly and efficiently we worked. It was such a privilege to work together :)
